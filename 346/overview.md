# Overview

## What is OOP?

Object-Orientated Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm.  Here are some characteristics of OOP:

- Data and operations are combined into a single bundle called an object.
- Classes are used to describe the blueprint of an object. Every object has a class.
- Classes can derive from one another.  This inheritance form an is-a relationship. (e.g. Car is a Vehicle, Airplane is a Vehicle)
- Method calls can be dynamically bound to methods.  This allows software components to be written generically against abstractions.
- Classes hide implementation details from the user of the class.  This is called information hiding.

A paradigm is just a model for how to look at or understand something.  OOP is just one paradigm for how to design software systems. Just because software is OOP does not imply that it is good, nor does a lack of object-orientation necessarily mean that software is somehow bad.

## Why study OOP?

- Learn abstraction mechanisms that will help you write larger, more organized programs.
- Learn to design software that can support new features through extension instead of modification. (Open/Closed Principle)
- Learn to design software that can be quickly, reliably, and automatically tested for faults or regressions.
- Most modern software systems and programming languages support OOP and most software systems today are designed using OOP.  Many popular libraries and frameworks use OOP.

## OOP Languages

Simula (1967) was the first language to introduce OOP features.  Smalltalk continued to develop and refine OOP features in the 70s.

Examples of languages that contain OO features:

- Ruby
- Python
- Smalltalk
- C++
- Java
- C#
- Objective-C
- Visual Basic
- Javascript

We'll focus mainly realizing OOP concepts with C++, but we'll try to look OOP features in other languages as time permits.

Most OO languages contain procedural elements or support a procedural style.

OO is a programming style.  It doesn't require language support, but it is much easier to write OOP in languages with OOP support.

## Programming Paradigms

OOP is one popular programming paradigm, but it isn't the only one.

- Procedural Programming
- Object-Orientated Programming
- Generic Programming
- Declarative Programming
- Functional Programming
- Meta Programming

A program might combine styles from various paradigms.  The paradigms themselves even have overlap.

We'll focus mainly on OO, but touch other topics as required.  We'll use previously learned procedural techniques.  Basics of generic programming in C++ will also be covered.  Some concepts from functional programming (immutability) will be integrated.

## Why C++?

C++ isn't a perfect language, and it certainly isn't the easiest language to explore OOP, but:

- You already have a good base of knowledge in C++
- Learning OOP gives the opportunity to round out your C++ skills
- Few widely used languages are more difficult than C++.  Learning something else after C++ should be pretty easy.

## C++ Strengths

- The language is very portable.  An application written in C++ can be easily and inexpensively deployed to a huge variety of platforms and systems.
- A huge variety of powerful abstraction mechanisms make it easier to write large programs.
- A large variety of well maintained libraries exists for C++.  This also includes C libraries.
- Uncompromising low-level efficiency 

### Where is it used?

C++ is used practically everywhere, but the following are some places where C++'s strengths make it especially well suited:

- Embedded Systems:  IoT, flight control, automotive software,  routers, electronics
- Core pieces of web/cloud infrastructure
- Desktop application software (especially portable software)
- System Software: Drivers, OSes
- Games
